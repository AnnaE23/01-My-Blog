Hello all! 

My name is Anna Edwards. I am a senior agricultural animal science major at the College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri, which is located just outside of Branson, Missouri. I was born and raised in Northwest Arkansas on a small farm where, at one point or another, we owned and cared for rabbits, cats, dogs, chickens, goats, sheep, cattle, and horses. As a result, I fell in love with the agriculture lifestyle and the plants and animals the are included in agriculture!

It has come to my attention that knowledge of agriculture is rapidly declining in many areas of the United States. Agriculture is one of the largest industries in the United States but ,despite this, vast numbers of United States population are uninformed about where their food comes from and the role that agriculture plays in their daily lives! According to a U.S Farmers and Ranchers Alliance survey, 72 percent of consumers reported knowing nothing or very little about farming or ranching. That is an incredible number! Because of this incredible percentage, I decide I would love to aid in decreaseing it  by endevouring to inform, explain and discuss some of the aspects involved in agriculture. Within this blog, I will narrow my focus down to mainly the beef cattle industry sector of agriculture and its impact on the Unites States. I will give examples of the daily life of a beef cattle producer and how agriculture life impacts the daily lifestyle of the farmer.  I will also discuss different breeds of beef cattle and the pros and cons of raising each breed. Cattle health, upbringing and quality of life of the animals will also be included in the list of topics discussed. 

I hope you will join me on this journey and hope that I can answer any questions you have regarding the impact of agriculture on the United States. Thank you so much for your time and interest!

Imagine a summertime barbeque with the sounds of a perfect steak sizzling on the grill as you flip it over and the fragrant aromas that it sends into the air. When you are grilling your steak do you ever think about where it came from? No, not the grocery store that it came from but where it actually originated?

A lot of time and hard labor goes into the steak that is making your mouth water. Time and labor given by a hard working and determined farmers. Farmers work in the scorching heat of the summer and in the frigid temperature of the winter in order to provide for the animals that produce the beef that you put off of your grill and put on your table. So, what exactly do farmers do to produce the quality beef you buy in the store? In order to understand this, we first need to explain some beef cattle terminology. 

There are four major cattle terms that you need to know in order to understand a beef cattle operation, these are heifers, cows, steers and bulls. Heifers are young females that are on track to becoming new mothers. Mature female cattle achieve ‘cow’ status when they have had two or more calves. Steers are a castrated male cow and bulls are an uncastrated male cow that is used for breeding purposes.

Okay, now that we have some basic terminology we can jump back in! The process of producing the beef that you buy in the store starts with the farmer deciding when he would like his cattle to calve. Would it be better for his cows to calve in the spring, in the fall or both? In order to determine this the farmer looks at two major things, when his cows are able to be bred and when the cattle prices are projected to be the highest. This often referred to as the cattle cyle which we will discuss next time!
