Hello all! 

My name is Anna Edwards. I am a senior agricultural animal science major at the College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri, which is located just outside of Branson, Missouri. I was born and raised in Northwest Arkansas on a small farm where, at one point or another, we owned and cared for rabbits, cats, dogs, chickens, goats, sheep, cattle, and horses. As a result, I fell in love with the agriculture lifestyle and the plants and animals the are included in agriculture!

It has come to my attention that knowledge of agriculture is rapidly declining in many areas of the United States. Agriculture is one of the largest industries in the United States but ,despite this, vast numbers of United States population are uninformed about where their food comes from and the role that agriculture plays in their daily lives! According to a U.S Farmers and Ranchers Alliance survey, 72 percent of consumers reported knowing nothing or very little about farming or ranching. That is an incredible number! Because of this incredible percentage, I decide I would love to aid in decreaseing it  by endevouring to inform, explain and discuss some of the aspects involved in agriculture. Within this blog, I will narrow my focus down to mainly the beef cattle industry sector of agriculture and its impact on the Unites States. I will give examples of the daily life of a beef cattle producer and how agriculture life impacts the daily lifestyle of the farmer.  I will also discuss different breeds of beef cattle and the pros and cons of raising each breed. Cattle health, upbringing and quality of life of the animals will also be included in the list of topics discussed. 

I hope you will join me on this journey and hope that I can answer any questions you have regarding the impact of agriculture on the United States. Thank you so much for your time and interest!
