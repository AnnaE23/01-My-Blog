Maybe you are from the city and are wanting to learn more about cattle, looking to start your own farm or are just looking for a place to refresh your memory. Even if you are here for a totally different reason, welcome! Today, we are going to go down to the very basics of cattle. Basics such as breeds of cattle and basic cattle terminology.

In the United States, cattle have diverged into two major breeds, meat-type (beef) breeds and milking-type (dairy) breeds. A few major beef breed are the Angus, American Brahman, Beefmaster, Charolais, Hereford, and Limousin. A few major dairy breeds are the Holstein, Jersey, Guernsey, Ayrshire, and Brown Swiss. There are several differences between dairy and beef cattle. Beef cattle are well-muscled with powerfully built legs and possess a short stout neck, a thick back without any visible backbone and round body. They are bred and fed to produce high-quality meat, with a minimum of bone or fat waste.

Dairy cattle, however, are more angular and long in shape with a thin neck, obvious spine, and fine-boned legs. Dairy cattle are bred and fed to produce milk, not meat. The udders (the bag between the cows’ rear legs where milk is stored also referred to as the mammary system) of dairy cows are often larger and may hang significantly lower than the udders on beef cows. Because of their angularity of shape, it is sometimes believed that dairy cattle are emaciated or malnourished but, even if it may appear this way, it is not true. Through what is known as artificial selection, dairy cattle are genetically predisposition to focus on milk production rather than on building muscle and fat.

Within both beef and dairy operations, there are a couple of terms that might be handy to know, these are the terms heifer, cow, steer and bull. A heifer is a young female that is on track to becoming a new mother. Mature female cattle achieve ‘cow’ status when they have had two or more calves. A steer is a castrated male cow and a bull is an uncastrated male cow that is most often used for breeding purposes.

Cattle farmers take great pride in their responsibility to provide proper care for their cattle and have recognized the need to properly care for their livestock. Through decades of practical experience and research, it has been found that sound animal husbandry practices have a great impact on the well-being, health of individual animals and on the productivity of the herd. Because cattle are produced in incredibly diverse location and environments within the United States there is not one specific set of production practices that will work for everyone. As such, all care and handling practices should be changed to suit the needs of each individual farm. Many farmers follow what is often referred to as the “Code of Cattle Care”. This “Code” is available through the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) and states the farmer must,

Provide necessary food, water and care to protect the health and well-being of animals.
Provide disease prevention practices to protect herd health, including access to veterinary medical care.
Provide facilities that allow safe, humane, and efficient movement and or restraint of cattle.
Use appropriate methods to humanely euthanize terminally sick or injured livestock and dispose of them properly.
Provide personnel with training and experience to properly handle and care for cattle.
Make timely observations of cattle to ensure basic needs are being met.
Minimize stress when transporting cattle.
Keep updated on advancements and changes in the industry to make decisions based upon sound production practices and consideration for animal well-being.
Persons who willfully mistreat animals will not be tolerated.
Handling also has a major role in the care of cattle

Abuse of cattle is not acceptable under any circumstances. Cattle should not be whipped or hit with objects that could cause injury, pain, or harm. Kicking, prodding, or any other forceful actions should not be used on non-ambulatory cattle. The use of sharp or hard solid objects to move cattle is not acceptable. Avoid slippery surfaces, especially where cattle enter a single file alley leading to a chute (a narrow metal enclosure for holding or restraining livestock, in which an animal may be vaccinated or branded) where they exit the chute. 􏰇rooved concrete, metal grating (not sharp), rubber mats or deep sand can be used to minimize slipping and falling. Quiet handling is essential to minimize slipping. Under most conditions, no more than 2􏰃% of the animals should fall outside the chute. A level of more than 2􏰃% indicates a review of the process may be of value, including asking questions such as􏰄 is this a cattle temperament issue or has something in the handling area changed that is affecting cattle behavior?


􏰀Take advantage of cattle’s flight zone and point of balance to move them. For safety and welfare reasons, minimize the use of electric prods. Non-electric driving aids, such as plastic paddles, sorting sticks, flags or streamers (affixed to long handles) should be used to quietly guide and turn animals. When cattle continuously balk, cattle handlers should investigate and correct the reason rather than resort to overuse of electric prods.

In previous posts, I discussed the distinctions between beef cattle and dairy cattle and provide a information on how to properly handle and care for them. In this post, I'm going to go a little deeper and provide a small amount of information on breeding and reproduction practices utilized in the production of cattle.

Cross-Breeding and Straight-Breeding

There are two main types of breeding that cattle producers utilize. Straight breeding and Cross-breeding. Straight-breeding means that the cattle produced are a pure breed of cattle, that use the same breed of sire and dam in mating. Within the process of straight breeding cattle inbreeding of animals can occur, this is often referred to as linebreeding. Linebreeding is a planned approach to inbreeding and concentrates genes and decreases variability within each individual animal. Crossbreeding is the mating of 2 or more purebreds of a different breed and is used when a farmer wants to upgrade his/her animals. The farmer will take a purebred sire and cross it with another breed.

Upgrading= cross purebred sire to other breeds

First cross = ½ blood
½ blood x purebred = ¾ blood
¾ blood x purebred= 7/8ths blood
7/8 x purebred = 15/16
15/16 x purebred = 31/32
Usually, 15/16 is minimum to be considered purebred

 Efficiency in the Cow Herd

Opinions vary on what is the most efficient cow. Large frame cattle (1400 lb cow vs 1100 lb cow) is 27% heavier but only has 20% higher dietary energy need. Some view smaller/medium frame cows as more efficient as you can stock more cows/Acre. However, both may be true: larger cows may be more profitable where feed is plentiful & smaller cows where feed is limited, thus it depends on the farmers wants/needs and where the farm is located.

Selecting for higher milk production

Selecting cattle with higher milk production for breeding will increase nutrient requirements of the animal in both quality and quantity. It may also lead to loss of body condition, increase feed inputs, decrease conceptions (calving rates) in the cow. Selecting for higher milk production promotes calf growth but it may also cause fat calves to be discounted at sale. It also must be considered that excessive milk production often skips a generation in beef cows. As in many aspects of cattle production, the farmer must select replacements from cows with “optimal milk production” for their specific environment and nutrition level.

Reproductive Efficiency

Reproductive Efficiency is the most important factor affecting cow-calf gross returns. Cows must (rebreed) have a live calf every 365 days. Calf crop percentage (percent of calves that survive) must meet a 90% benchmark. Cows calve in first 30 days of the calving season with an 80% benchmark.

 Practices to Improve Herd Reproductive Efficiency

Proper nutrition: CP, TDN, Mineral/Vitamin.
Estrus sync programs and protocols.
Proper heifer & 2 y/o development program.
Disease prevention.
Calf management.
Maintain bull fertility.
Cull infertile/unproductive cows.
 Controlled Calving

Leads to selection for higher fertility if culling those outside the calving season and a better comparison of cow & calf performance. With controlled calving it is easier to manage herd health (vaccinations, castration, other management activities), determine pregnancies and easier to manage nutrition.


I hope today's blog was a helpful insight into the breeding and reproduction practices utilized within cattle production! I hope you will join me as I continue with part two tomorrow.

**Blog post #4**

In part one, I gave an overview of a few aspects of beef cow breeding and production, such as line-breeding and cross-breeding and reproduction efficiency. Today I am going to continue talking about breeding and reproduction, focusing on calving and heifer development.

Calving

There are three main calving seasons, spring, fall, and winter.

Spring Calving

Spring calving occurs in the months of March and April. This is when the cow hits peak milk production during the onset of spring grass. Cow rebreeding is also aided by the higher pasture quality. However, spring is often cold and wet which increases chances of morbidity (disease) and mortality (death) of calves.

Fall Calving

Fall calving falls in the months of September and October. Temperatures in the fall are often cool but have a tendency towards unpredictability. Fall calving requires fall pastures and often feed to achieve optimal milk production. Fescue toxicity (a warm season condition characterized by reduced feed intake and weight gains or milk production) is less of a problem at re-breeding in December. Fall born calves are often sold on a higher market than spring-born.

Winter (early spring)

Winter calving occurs in the months of January and February. The frigid temperature during this time require more attention to cattle and also require more facilities. Providing feed through peak milk can become incredibly costly. Diseases such as calf scours (a clinical sign associated with several diseases characterized by diarrhea) and pneumonia may be a bigger problem. However, unique marketing situations, such as show cattle,  may provide an incentive for winter calving.

Calving Management

No matter what season a cow is calving, the farmer must be aware of calving dates and monitor often and closely. At calving, a heifer should be fed and calve separately from the other cows. The goal of calving death loss is less than five percent. It is sometimes necessary to provide facilities for calving with clean, dry pens for calving. If calving in the winter, windbreaks and calf shelters are helpful.  

Signs of Calving

When a cow begins to calve she will often separate herself from the herd. Udder enlargement and teat strutting may occur weeks before and up to a day after calving. The Relaxed will begin to relax around tailhead/pelvis of the cow and appearance of the water sac.

When to assist with calving

You should assist with calving 60 minutes after water sac or hard labor, if dew claws facing up (calf is backwards), the calf's nose/head visible first and if the front feet protrude without the appearance of the nose. You should also assist if there is the appearance of the head with only one foot and if calving has begun but the cow is excessively straining with no progress or is not trying at all.

 

Heifer Development

The age of a heifer at puberty is a key factor for breeding success.

Factors Affecting Onset of Puberty

Heifers need to attain at least 65-70% of their mature body before the start of the breeding season. Weight is the most predictable and manageable factor of heifer development.  It is preferred that heifers cycle through their first estrous cycle thirty days prior to the breeding season since the first estrous cycle is typically less fertile. Age at puberty is influenced by genetics, level of nutrition, and pre-pubertal gains. Age at puberty is a moderately heritable trait. Heterosis (crossbreeding) has been shown to decrease the age at which puberty is attained.


 Replacement Heifer Development

Select 20% more heifers for development than needed, to allow for culling.
Breed heifers 20-30 days before cow herd.
Limit the breeding to 30-45 days and cull.
Rule of thumb: heifers gain 1.5-2 lbs. ADG (average daily gain) from weaning to puberty.
Pelvic measurement and reproductive tract score.
Vaccinate as yearlings and prior to calving
